Additionally, this method requires a large amount of memory. On the other hand, the indirect method is known for its extreme precision.

In the indirect method, we address each arc separately.  We begin by defining the flow of the Hamiltonian associated with each arc. To accomplish this, we use the function Flow that can be found in the CTFlows.jl package. This latter allows to solve the Hamiltonian system over a given time interval from given initial values of the state and the adjoint vector. This function requires necessary libraries such as  \\texttt{ForwardDiff} for calculating gradients and Jacobians and  OrdinaryDiffEq for solving ordinary differential equations.
